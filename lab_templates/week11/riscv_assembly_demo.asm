# This sample program for RISC-V simulation using RARS

# ------- <code memory (ROM mapped to Instruction Memory) begins>
.text	## IROM segment 0x00000000-0x000001FC
# Total number of instructions should not exceed 128 (127 excluding the last line 'halt B halt').

# Note : see the wiki regarding the pseudoinstructions li and la. 
# Pseudoinstructions may be implemented using more than one actual instruction. See the assembled code in the Execute tab of RARS
# You can also use the actual register numbers directly. For example, instead of s1, you can write x9

main:   
	addi s1, zero, 2
	slli s1, s1, 12
	addi s1, s1, 1024
	addi s2, s1, 4
	addi s3, s2, 20
loop:

	lw s4, (s2)			# reading DIPS
	sw s4, (s1)			# writing to LEDS
	sw s4, (s3)
	j loop			# continue in the loop

halt:	
	jal halt		# infinite loop to halt computation. A program should not "terminate" without an operating system to return control to
				# keep halt: jal halt as the last line of your code.

# Total number of constants should not exceed 128
# If a variable is accessed multiple times, it is better to store the address in a register and use it rather than load it repeatedly.

# All variables should be declared in this section, adjusting the space directive as necessary. This section is read-write.
# Total number of variables should not exceed 128. 
# No initialization possible in this region. In other words, you should write to a location before you can read from it (i.e., write to a location using sw before reading using lw).
