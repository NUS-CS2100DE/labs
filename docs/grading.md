# Grading of Labs

The lab assignments for this course are worth 40% of your overall grade. There will be two main forms of assessment for labs:

## Lab assignments

The lab manuals for some weeks clearly indicate that a lab assignment is included for that week. There are questions embedded in the manuals for those weeks. 

!!! question "Question 1"
	This is how the questions in the manuals are presented. 

Please use your preferred word processor (Word, Google Docs, Pages, Overleaf, LibreOffice Writer etc.) to create a document, and use headings to separate the answers to each question in the manual. The questions may ask you to include code, screenshots, or written answers. 

The weightage of each assignment, as well as that of each question within the assignment, is clearly specified in each manual. 

Upload your solutions for each of the assignments to Canvas by the end of the lab session at noon. Late submissions will be accepted for 30 minutes, with a penalty of 10% of your score for every 15 minutes you are late. That is, for submitting between 12:00 and 12:15, you will be penalised 10%; for submitting between 12:15 and 12:30, you will be penalised 20%.
