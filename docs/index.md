Welcome to CS2100DE! In this website and accompanying repository, you will find all the materials for the labs for CS2100DE. 

## Intended learning outcomes (labs)

In the lab component of this course, you will put into practice the concepts learned in the lecture, and see them come to life. 

You will learn:

* What an FPGA is, and how to use them and their accompanying tools and software 
* How to design simple (and not-so-simple) logic circuits with SystemVerilog
* The RISC-V architecture and assembly language
* How to build your very own CPU which can execute real RISC-V programs!

## First steps

To make the most of the labs, we recommend doing some reading before you come for your first session. 

1. First, the page on [how to use this website](howto.md). Pay special attention to the section on "How to get help", as it is very important. 

2. Next, the [prerequisites for the lab](guides/prerequisites.md). If you have any concerns with these prerequisites, please approach the teaching team as early as possible. 

3. You should also read the [grading scheme for lab assignments and projects](grading.md). 

4. Finally, make sure you read [Getting to know your Nexys 4](guides/nexys4.md) and [install Vivado](https://nus-cg3207.github.io/labs/Vivado_Installation_and_Getting_Started/vivado_install_guide/) on your personal computer as soon as possible. If you do not have access to a Windows or Linux (preferred) PC, you should try your best to get/borrow one for this course.
