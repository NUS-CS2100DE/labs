## How to get help

If you have any questions regarding the content of any of the labs, please follow these steps, *in this order*, to answer them.  

1. Please read the lab manual closely. We will try our best to keep the manual updated with any common errors, or issues, that you may face. 

2. If the lab manual does not answer your question, [the lab repository](https://github.com/nus-cs2100de/labs) has a [discussions page](https://github.com/NUS-CS2100DE/labs/discussions). Please search here for your question, in case it has already been answered before. We will leave questions and answers from previous semesters on this page, so over time, more and more information should be covered between here and the manuals. 

3. If you cannot find an answer to your question in the discussions either, then please create a new discussion. Make sure your title is as succinct, but descriptive, as possible, for the benefit of others who may search the issues page later. Also, do make sure you include all relevant details in the discussion content. [This webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-ask-good-technical-questions/) offers some helpful advice on how to ask good technical questions. 

4. Please **DO NOT** send emails to the teaching staff asking technical questions regarding the lab activities. We will ignore all such emails, with no exception. Post all technical questions to the discussions page. This benefits others, because anyone who has the issue in the future can solve it quickly with a search. It also benefits you, because you may receive an answer faster from a classmate, than from us. 

On that subject, please do join in and help each other out in the discussions as far as possible.
